ProductivityApp
===============
This is a web app designed to help students (and maybe other people) organize
their tasks by putting them in a hierarchy and breaking down their larger projects
into smaller pieces. 

This app uses the Django framework with a MySQL back-end and uses South to handle
database migrations.
